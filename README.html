        <h2>üì¢ April 2025: Cloud Phishing Surge</h2>
        <p>Phishing remains one of the most widespread cyber threats, and its evolution into targeting cloud-based platforms has become a serious concern in 2025. Cybercriminals now create fake multi-factor authentication (MFA) pages to deceive users and capture login credentials from services like Google Drive, Microsoft 365, and Dropbox.</p>
        <p>These attacks are highly convincing and have successfully breached corporate email systems and file storage networks. Security teams recommend using application-based MFA like Google Authenticator instead of SMS or email codes, which are more vulnerable to interception.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a secure password manager.</li>
          <li>Enable app-based two-factor authentication.</li>
          <li>Don‚Äôt click on suspicious login prompts.</li>
          <li>Monitor account activity regularly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Recent Incident:</strong> In March 2025, a popular university‚Äôs student portal was compromised using a phishing link sent to students, resulting in the exposure of academic records.</p>

        <h2>üìö Case Study: Colonial Pipeline Attack</h2>
        <p>The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May 2021 brought attention to how cyberattacks can cripple critical infrastructure. The attackers used a single compromised password to access internal systems, encrypting data and demanding millions in cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p>This breach forced the company to halt pipeline operations, causing fuel shortages across the eastern United States. It also sparked national debate on how prepared essential services are against modern cyber threats.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure backups are offline and regularly tested.</li>
          <li>Use endpoint protection across all employee devices.</li>
          <li>Train staff to spot phishing attempts.</li>
          <li>Monitor systems for unusual activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Latest Note:</strong> The Colonial case led to major changes in U.S. infrastructure cybersecurity policies.</p>
